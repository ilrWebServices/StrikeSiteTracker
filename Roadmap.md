# Striketracker Road Map

## Known issues / To Dos

- [x] Enable a data backup / snapshot plan
- [x] Add editors and configure access permissions
- [ ] Fix remaining migration errors
- [x] Manual archiving of sources is required, but we can discuss archive options
- [x] PDF sources have not been migrated, and we should discuss
- [ ] Might need a bit more state, demands, and industries cleanup
- [x] The filter form still kind of gets in the way. Should we allow it to slide off-screen or collapse in some way?
- [x] Clean up CSS 
- [x] Improve responsive layout
- [x] Add link to Bluesky
- [x] Add a data export to the build process. Maybe `/data.csv`?
- [ ] Accommodate that one non-day duration (the 12 minute strike)?
- [ ] Need a <= 1 day duration

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Switch to a live feed of labor actions so that the map updates in real time
- [ ] Switch to vector tiles with https://maplibre.org/ and https://openfreemap.org 
- [ ] Consider archiving source URLs ourselves, either using the Cornell Library Archive-it service or something like http://archivebox.io/

                  >Welcome to the Cornell-ILR Labor Action Tracker. The goal of
                  our project is to provide a comprehensive database of strike and
                  labor protest activity across the United States in order to
                  better inform and support labor movement activists,
                  policymakers, and scholars. We would like to especially thank
                  and acknowledge the ILR School for generous funding to support
                  our project. We also thank the staff at <a

              We began tracking strikes in late-2020 and labor protests in early-2021. Our database of strikes and labor protests is most accurate as of March 2021. We have a relatively high degree of confidence in our ability to capture strike activity, while we are still reaching scale with regard to labor protests. All information we gather is from public sources and manually inputted into our tracker. Please see our methodology document for a more detailed description of our definitions, protocols, and variables.

            Welcome to the Cornell-ILR Labor Action Tracker. The goal of
            our project is to provide a comprehensive database of strike and
            labor protest activity across the United States in order to
            better inform and support labor movement activists,
            policymakers, and scholars. We would like to especially thank
            and acknowledge the ILR School for generous funding to support
            our project. We also thank the staff at <a href="https://clb.org.hk/" target="_blank">China Labour
              Bulletin</a>
            for inspiring and encouraging us to develop the labor action
            tracker.
          </p>
          <p>
            We began documenting strikes in late-2020 and labor protests in early-2021. Our database of strikes is most
            accurate as of 2021. We have a relatively high degree of confidence in our ability to comprehensively
            capture
            strike activity. Due to the high number of labor protests across the United States, we aim to provide a
            general understanding of labor protest activity rather than achieve a complete count. Please note that our
            map
            generates the total number of strike and/or labor protest locations, which is more than the total number of
            individual strikes and/or protests (e.g. a single strike at five locations will appear five times on our
            map).
            Information we gather is from public sources and manually inputted into our tracker. Please see our
            methodology document for a more detailed description of our definitions, protocols, and variables. Follow us
            on twitter <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ILRLaborAction">@ILRLaborAction</a> to keep up to
            date
            with our project!

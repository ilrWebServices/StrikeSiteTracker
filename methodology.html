          <p class="p2 ft2">Introduction</p>
          <p class="p3 ft3">
            The goal of the <nobr>Cornell-ILR</nobr> Labor Action Tracker is to
            provide a comprehensive database of strike and labor protest activity
            across the United States displayed on an interactive map. This
            document contains information about our methodology, specifically how
            we capture and collect information about strikes and labor protests.
            We outline our methodology through three sections below. In Section I,
            we distinguish between strikes and labor protests by developing
            separate definitions for each. In Section II, we discuss our search
            and verification protocols to outline how we find and add events to
            our tracker. In Section III, we define and explain the variables we
            capture for each event.
          </p>
          <p class="p4 ft3">
            Our tracker provides links to our original sources that we use to
            compile and manually input information about each strike or labor
            protest. However, we often have to use our own judgment to make final
            determinations about certain variables, as available information can
            be partial or ambiguous. We will continue to be transparent about any
            changes we make to this document as our project grows and develops.
            Note that we often refer to strikes and labor protests in the below
            sections as “events.”
          </p>
          <p class="p5 ft2">Section I: Definitions</p>
          <p class="p6 ft3">
            On our interactive map, users can filter based on whether we label an
            event a strike or a labor protest, which we define below. Users also
            can search for both strikes <span class="ft4">and </span>labor
            protests, which compiles our complete database of labor action across
            the United States.
          </p>

        <p class="p13 ft3">
          We distinguish between strikes and labor protests as a core component of
          our labor action tracker. The major distinction between strikes and
          labor protests relates to whether a group of workers stopped work during
          the course of the event. We believe this definition of strikes is
          relatively inclusive, but we need to convincingly demonstrate that a
          stoppage of work led by a group of workers occurs to label an event a
          strike.
        </p>
        <p class="p14 ft2">Section II: Protocols</p>
        <p class="p15 ft15">Search protocols</p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">
          We collect information on strikes and labor protests from a variety of
          sources, building on many of the protocols that the Bureau of Labor
          Statistics (BLS) employ to search for work stoppages.<span class="ft16"
            >3 </span
          >These sources include, but are not limited to, the BLS strike report,
          the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS) work stoppage
          summary, Bloomberg Law’s work stoppage database, major media sources,
          organizational press releases, and social media. At the moment, we are
          only searching for <nobr>English-language</nobr> sources.
        </p>
        <p class="p16 ft15">Verification protocols</p>
        <p class="p17 ft8">
          Our verification protocols determine the number and type of sources we
          require to add an event to our tracker. We identify three different
          categories of sources with corresponding protocols:
        </p>
        <p class="p18 ft3">
          <span class="ft5">Tier I</span>) These are sources that have tracked
          strike data for a considerable period of time. We can feel confident
          both that the event occurred, and the nature of the event was presented
          accurately. We automatically enter these events into our database
          without additional verification.
        </p>
        <p class="p19 ft8">
          Tier I sources include the BLS strike report, the FMCS work stoppage
          summary, and Bloomberg Law’s work stoppage database.
        </p>
        <p class="p20 ft3">
          <span class="ft5">Tier II) </span>These are sources either connected to
          the labor movement or press coverage of the labor movement. We can feel
          confident that the event occurred, but we need to make sure that the
          event is labeled correctly according to our definitions and that we
          accurately capture correct information pertaining to the variables
          listed in Section III. To add events generated from one of these
          sources, we require additional verification from another Tier II source
          or Tier III source.
        </p>
          <p class="p23 ft3">
            Examples of Tier II sources include, but are not limited to,
            union/labor organization press releases, Labor Notes, The New York
            Times, local affiliates of major networks such as NBC or CBS, local
            news sources such as The Buffalo News or The Ithaca Voice, and news
            sources that cover specific industries.
          </p>
          <p class="p24 ft0">
            <span class="ft1">Tier III</span>) These are nontraditional sources

              >sources. These sources are more difficult to rely on if we want to
              feel confident that the event is labeled correctly according to our
              definitions and that we accurately capture correct information
              pertaining to the variables listed in Section III. To count these
              events, we require additional verification from one Tier II source
              or one Tier III source. Every effort should be made to verify a Tier
              III source with at least one additional Tier II source.</span

          </p>
          <p class="p26 ft8">
            Examples of Tier III sources include, but are not limited to, social
            media posts, such as Twitter and Facebook, and online forums, such as
            Reddit.
          </p>
          <p class="p5 ft2">Section III: Variables and filters</p>
          <p class="p27 ft3">
            For each event, we try to capture data on a set of variables to
            provide as much information as possible. We gather all of this
            information from the sources we cite for the event, occasionally
            looking up additional information (such as a specific address for the
            event if not mentioned in the sources). Not all variables are captured
            for each event, either because they are not applicable to the event or
            because we are not able to capture reliable information for particular
            variables. The variables are listed below in the order they appear
            when searching a specific event. Users are able to filter according to
            some of these variables (marked below by *) using our filtering
            mechanisms available on the main page.

              <span class="ft22">Employer</span>: Name of the employer involved in
              the event, if applicable. We generally list the employer name
              referenced in our sources. In the event that workers are legally
              considered independent contractors, we try to list the company that
              organizes and manages their work.

              unions, worker centers, and/or other labor organizations. For unions,
              the name of the international union will generally go here. When
              filtering for labor organization, please use an acronym (e.g., SEIU,
              IBT) for most inclusive results.

          unionized workers or workers in the middle of a unionization campaign.

        <p class="p34 ft23">
          <span class="ft22">Number of Locations</span>: The number of locations
          for a given event. For example, a single strike at 12 locations would
          read 12 for this variable. Note that when this number is greater than
          one, link(s) to the other locations will appear after the last variable
          below. Also note that we cannot find all locations for some events,
          which will be acknowledged in the

          events may involve community members and other individuals beyond the

          protests, these demands are not limited to traditional workplace
          demands. We have developed a list of ten demands (see below) that users

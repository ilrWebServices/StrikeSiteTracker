      <p class="p2 ft2">Introduction</p>
      <p class="p3 ft3">
        The goal of the Cornell-ILR Labor Action Tracker is to provide a
        comprehensive database of strike and labor protest activity across
        the United States displayed on an interactive map. This document
        contains information about our methodology, specifically how we
        capture and collect information about strikes and labor protests. We
        outline our methodology through three sections below. In Section I,
        we distinguish between strikes and labor protests by developing
        separate definitions for each. In Section II, we discuss our search
        and verification protocols to outline how we find and add events to
        our tracker. In Section III, we define and explain the variables we
        capture for each event. We also plan to release a short summary <a target="_blank"
          href="https://twitter.com/ILRLaborAction">via our
          Twitter account</a> on the third Monday of each month detailing the
        labor actions we captured over the prior month.
      </p>
      <p class="p4 ft3">
        Our tracker provides links to original sources that we use to
        compile and manually input information about each strike or labor
        protest. However, we often have to use our own judgment to make
        final determinations about certain variables, as available
        information can be partial or ambiguous. We meet regularly to
        discuss certain labor actions, especially to decide whether to label
        a specific event a strike or a labor protest. We will continue to be
        transparent about any changes we make to this document as our
        project grows and develops. Note that we often refer to strikes and
        labor protests in the below sections as "events."
      </p>
      <p class="p5 ft2">Section I: Definitions</p>
      <p class="p6 ft3">
        On our interactive map, users can filter based on whether we label an
        event a strike or a labor protest, which we define below. Users also
        can search for both strikes <span class="ft4">and </span>labor
        protests, which compiles our complete database of labor action across
        the United States.
      </p>
      <p class="p7 ft5">
        <span class="ft4">Strike</span><span class="ft3">: </span>“A temporary
        stoppage of work by a group of workers in order to express a grievance
        or to enforce a demand. Such a grievance or demand may or may not be
        workplace-related.”
      </p>
      <p class="p8 ft0">
        --The first sentence of this definition is heavily
        influenced by Peterson (1937: 3),<span class="ft6">1 </span>also
      </p>
      <p class="p9 ft8">
        used by Hyman (1989: 17).<span class="ft7">2 </span>The only
        difference we make to the first part of this definition is by changing
        “employees” to “workers.”
      </p>
      <p class="p10 ft5">
        <span class="ft4">Labor Protest</span><span class="ft3">: </span>“Collective action by a group of people as
        workers but without withdrawing their labor in order to express a
        grievance or enforce a demand. Such a grievance or demand may or may
        not be workplace-related. A labor protest may
        <em>also</em> consist of a group of people not acting
        in the protest as workers as long as the central demand is
        workplace related.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="p13 ft3">
      We distinguish between strikes and labor protests as a core component of
      our labor action tracker. The major distinction between strikes and
      labor protests relates to whether a group of workers stopped work during
      the course of the event. We believe this definition of strikes is
      relatively inclusive, but we need to convincingly demonstrate that a
      stoppage of work led by a group of workers occurs to label an event a
      strike.
    </p>
    <p class="p14 ft2">Section II: Protocols</p>
    <p class="p15 ft15">Search protocols</p>
    <p class="p6 ft3">
      We collect information on strikes and labor protests from a variety of
      sources, building on many of the protocols that the Bureau of Labor
      Statistics (BLS) employ to search for work stoppages.<span class="ft16">3 </span>These sources include, but are
      not limited to, the BLS strike report,
      the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS) work stoppage
      summary, Bloomberg Law’s work stoppage database, major media sources,
      organizational press releases, and social media. We are currently
      searching for English and Spanish-language sources.
    </p>
    <p class="p16 ft15">Verification protocols</p>
    <p class="p17 ft8">
      Our verification protocols determine the number and type of sources we
      require to add an event to our tracker. We identify three different
      categories of sources with corresponding protocols:
    </p>
    <p class="p18 ft3">
      <span class="ft5">Tier I</span>) These are sources that have tracked
      strike data for a considerable period of time. We can feel confident
      both that the event occurred, and the nature of the event was presented
      accurately. We automatically enter these events into our database
      without additional verification.
    </p>
    <p class="p19 ft8">
      Tier I sources include the BLS strike report, the FMCS work stoppage
      summary, and Bloomberg Law’s work stoppage database.
    </p>
    <p class="p20 ft3">
      <span class="ft5">Tier II) </span>These are sources either connected to
      the labor movement or press coverage of the labor movement. We can feel
      confident that the event occurred, but we need to make sure that the
      event is labeled correctly according to our definitions and that we
      accurately capture correct information pertaining to the variables
      listed in Section III. To add events generated from one of these
      sources, we require additional verification from another Tier II source
      or Tier III source.
    </p>
    <p class="p23 ft3">
      Examples of Tier II sources include, but are not limited to,
      union/labor organization press releases, Labor Notes, The New York
      Times, local affiliates of major networks such as NBC or CBS, local
      news sources such as The Buffalo News or The Ithaca Voice, and news
      sources that cover specific industries.
    </p>
    <p class="p24 ft0">
      <span class="ft1">Tier III</span>) These are nontraditional sources
      that may capture activity not covered by Tier I or Tier II sources. These sources are more difficult to rely on if
      we want to
      feel confident that the event is labeled correctly according to our
      definitions and that we accurately capture correct information
      pertaining to the variables listed in Section III. To count these
      events, we require additional verification from one Tier II source
      or one Tier III source. Every effort should be made to verify a Tier
      III source with at least one additional Tier II source.
    </p>
    <p class="p26 ft8">
      Examples of Tier III sources include, but are not limited to, social media posts, such as Twitter and Facebook,
      and online forums, such as Reddit. An email exchange or other contact with informants, such as workers or labor
      organization representatives, to verify or learn more about an event also counts as a Tier III source.

    </p>
    <p class="p5 ft2">Section III: Variables and filters</p>
    <p class="p27 ft3">
      For each event, we try to capture data on a set of variables to
      provide as much information as possible. We gather all of this
      information from the sources we cite for the event, occasionally
      looking up additional information (such as a specific address for the
      event if not mentioned in the sources). Not all variables are captured
      for each event, either because they are not applicable to the event or
      because we are not able to capture reliable information for particular
      variables. The variables are listed below in the order they appear
      when searching a specific event. Users are able to filter according to
      some of these variables (marked below by *) using our filtering
      mechanisms available on the main page.
    </p>
    <p class="p27 ft3">
      Please note that the number of events listed on our map does not necessarily reflect the number of individual
      strikes and/or labor protests, but rather the total number of locations of strikes and/or labor protests. For
      example, a single strike at five locations will count as five separate “results found” on our map.
    </p>
    <p class="p28 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">Employer</span>: Name of the employer involved in
      the event, if applicable. We generally list the employer name
      referenced in our sources. In the event that workers are legally
      considered independent contractors, we try to list the company that
      organizes and manages their work.
    </p>
    <p class="p29 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">*Labor organization</span>: Name of the labor
      organization(s) involved in the event, if applicable. This includes
      unions, worker centers, and/or other labor organizations. For unions,
      the name of the international union will generally go here. When
      filtering for labor organization, please use an acronym (e.g., SEIU,
      IBT) for most inclusive results.
    </p>
    <p class="p30 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">Local</span>: Name of the local labor organization
      involved in the event, if applicable. This includes locals of unions
      or local associations of other labor organizations such as worker
      centers.
    </p>
    <p class="p31 ft26">
      <span class="ft24">*Industry</span>: Industry of employer involved in
      the event, if applicable. We generate our list of industries from the
      2017 NAICS.<span class="ft25">4</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p33 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">*Bargaining Unit Size</span>: The number of workers
      in the bargaining unit related to the event if we are able to determine
      this information. This is only applicable for events that feature
      unionized workers or workers in the middle of a unionization campaign.
    </p>
    <p class="p34 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">Number of Locations</span>: The number of locations
      for a given event. For example, a single strike at 12 locations would
      read 12 for this variable. Note that when this number is greater than
      one, link(s) to the other locations will appear after the last variable
      below. Also note that we cannot find all locations for some events,
      which will be acknowledged in the
      <span class="ft22">Notes </span>variable below.
    </p>
    <p class="p35 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">Address (city, *state, zip code)</span>: The address
      of the event, which allows us to pinpoint the event on our interactive
      map. Note that users can filter by state, which includes all states and
      territories of the United States.
    </p>
    <p class="p36 ft26">
      <span class="ft24">*Strike or Protest</span>: Whether we categorize the
      event as a strike or a labor protest according to our definitions in
      Section I.
    </p>
    <p class="p37 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">*Approximate Number of Participants: </span>The
      number of participants in a given event, if we are able to determine
      this information. Note that this category potentially applies to both
      union and nonunion events. We choose the word “participants” as some
      events may involve community members and other individuals beyond the
      workers directly involved in the event.
    </p>
    <p class="p38 ft26">
      <span class="ft24">*Start Date: </span>The start date of the event. Note
      that we began tracking strikes in late-2020 and labor
      protests in early-2021, so many of the older start dates
      refer to longer, ongoing events.
    </p>
    <p class="p16 ft28">
      <span class="ft27">End Date:</span> The end date of the event. Please note that for the sake of our monthly report
      we will assume an event has ended if we cannot find a news article or other reference for a full three months.
    </p>
    <p class="p39 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">*Duration Amount: </span>The number of days, hours,
      or minutes of an event. Note that we only capture duration for strikes
      and that this generally includes all calendar days that the strike
      covers.
    </p>
    <p class="p29 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">Duration Unit: </span>Days, hours, or minutes of an
      event. Note that we only capture duration unit for strikes. Strikes are
      generally captured in days unless we can demonstrate the strike lasted a
      certain number of minutes or hours less than one day.
    </p>
    <p class="p40 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">*Authorized:</span> Whether the local union or local union leadership actively supported the
      event. This variable only applies to unionized workplaces (after formal recognition of a union). Note that we only
      capture the authorized variable for strikes.
    </p>
    <p class="p41 ft23">
      <span class="ft22">*Worker Demands:</span> The main demands associated with an event. We have developed a list of
      twelve demands (see below) that users can filter by based on some of the most frequently identified worker demands
      from our first approximately 1,000 entries.
    </p>
    <p class="p43 ft23">
      Note that these twelve demands do <em>not</em> preclude us from listing other demands for individual events.
